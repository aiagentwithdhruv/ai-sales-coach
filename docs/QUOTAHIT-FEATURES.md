## 19. AI Sales Agent — Sarah

### Overview
A proactive AI sales agent that lives on the pricing page as a floating chat widget. Sarah greets visitors, answers product questions, handles objections, and captures leads — powered by Grok 4.1 Fast via OpenRouter.

### Features

| **Animated Widget** | Pulsing cyan glow with spinning border gradient |

### How It Works

1. Visitor lands on the pricing page
2. After 10 seconds, the chat widget auto-opens with a chime sound
3. Sarah greets the visitor: "Hey there! I'm Sarah. Noticed you checking out pricing..."
4. Visitor asks questions about features, pricing, or use cases
5. When visitor shows interest, Sarah naturally captures their name and email
6. Lead data POSTs to n8n webhook → Telegram notification to Dhruv + Google Sheet logging
