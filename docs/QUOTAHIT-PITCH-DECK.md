## SLIDE 1 — Title Slide

**QuotaHit**
The AI Sales Intelligence Platform

*Practice. Analyze. Close.*
*Powered by 25+ AI Models.*

www.quotahit.com

[Visual: Dark background, QuotaHit logo centered, subtle gradient glow behind the logo, tagline below]

*Speaker Note: "Thank you for your time today. I'm going to show you how QuotaHit can transform your sales team's performance — and save you $50K+ per year while doing it."*

---

## SLIDE 2 — The Problem (Hook)

### Your Sales Team Has a $1.2M Problem

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 57% of reps miss quota every year | Lost revenue |
| Average rep ramp time: 9.1 months | Wasted salary |
| 65% of sales training forgotten in 7 days | Wasted training budget |
| Managers spend 6+ hrs/week on call reviews | Lost selling time |
| Reps juggle 5-7 different tools daily | Context switching kills productivity |

**The cost of an underperforming rep: $115,000/year**
(Base salary + lost deals + management time + tool costs)

[Visual: Red/amber warning icons next to each stat. Large "$1.2M" number at top in bold. Bottom stat in a callout box]

*Speaker Note: "These aren't hypothetical numbers. Research from CSO Insights and Gartner shows that over half of B2B sales reps consistently miss their targets. The average company with 10 reps is leaving $1.2M on the table every year."*

---

## SLIDE 3 — Why This Happens

### The Sales Stack is Broken

**Current Reality:**
```
Training → Classroom sessions → Forgotten in a week
Practice → Role-play with managers → Awkward, inconsistent, 2x/month max
Call Review → Manual or Gong ($250/user) → Hours of work per call
CRM → Salesforce ($300/user) → Separate tool, no coaching link
Outbound → Orum ($250/user) → Just a dialer, nothing else
```

**Total cost per rep: $400-800/month across 5-7 tools**
**And they STILL miss quota.**

[Visual: Flowchart showing fragmented tools with red X marks. Show 5-7 tool logos scattered with price tags. Arrow pointing to "Still Missing Quota" in red]

*Speaker Note: "The problem isn't your reps. It's the stack. They're drowning in tools that don't talk to each other, getting trained twice a year in classrooms, and practicing maybe twice a month with busy managers."*

---

## SLIDE 4 — The Solution

### One Platform. Everything Your Sales Team Needs.

**QuotaHit** replaces 5-7 tools with one AI-powered platform:

| Replaces | Category | QuotaHit Module |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Gong / Chorus | Call Analytics | Call Analyzer |
| Salesforce / HubSpot | CRM | Built-in CRM |
| Orum / Nooks | AI Dialer | AI Calling Engine |
| Second Nature | Training | Voice Practice |
| Lavender | Coaching | AI Objection Coach |
| Outreach / Salesloft | Engagement | Campaigns + Follow-ups |

**One login. One bill. One platform that actually works together.**

[Visual: Left side shows 6 scattered tool logos with price tags adding up to $800+. Arrow/transformation in middle. Right side shows single QuotaHit logo with "$149/user". Clean, impactful comparison]

*Speaker Note: "QuotaHit consolidates everything into one platform. Your reps open one tool in the morning and it handles coaching, practice, calling, CRM, and analytics. No more switching between 7 tabs."*

---

## SLIDE 5 — Product Overview (The Platform)

### The Complete AI Sales Intelligence Platform

[Visual: Dashboard screenshot in center. 6 feature boxes surrounding it with icons and short labels]

**6 Core Modules:**

1. **AI Objection Coach** — Instant, AI-powered objection handling
2. **Voice Practice** — Real-time AI roleplay with buyer personas
3. **Call Analyzer** — Upload calls, get instant AI scoring
4. **Smart CRM** — Contact management with AI enrichment
5. **AI Calling Engine** — Automated outbound campaigns
6. **Performance Analytics** — Skills radar, score trends, insights

**Powered by 25+ AI models** including GPT-5, Claude 4.5, Gemini 3, Kimi K2.5

*Speaker Note: "Let me walk you through each module and how it directly impacts your team's revenue."*

---

## SLIDE 6 — Module 1: AI Objection Coach

### Never Lose a Deal to an Objection Again

**What it does:** Rep types any objection → AI generates the perfect response in 3 seconds

**Real example:**
> Prospect: *"Your solution costs 3x more than what we're paying now."*
>
> QuotaHit Coach: *"I hear you — that's a significant investment. Let me reframe: your current solution costs you $X in [specific pain]. Our customers see [specific ROI] within 90 days. So the real question is: can you afford NOT to switch?"*

**Key features:**
- 7+ AI models to choose from
- Upload product docs, competitor PDFs, prospect websites for context
- 20+ pre-built objection templates (Price, Timing, Authority, Need, Trust)
- Audio playback to practice tone and delivery
- Every session auto-saved for team review

**Impact:** Reps respond to objections 10x faster with higher quality

[Visual: Split screen — left shows a chat UI with objection input, right shows AI-generated response with coaching highlights. Clean, modern dark UI]

*Speaker Note: "Before QuotaHit, a new rep hears 'you're too expensive' and freezes. With QuotaHit, they get a tailored, context-aware response in 3 seconds — using YOUR product data and competitor intel."*

---

## SLIDE 7 — Module 2: Real-Time Voice Practice

### 10x More Practice. Zero Scheduling.

**What it does:** Reps have real voice conversations with AI buyer personas — as realistic as a real prospect call.

**4 AI Personas with unique personalities:**

| Persona | Role | Difficulty |
|---------|------|------------|
| Sarah Chen | VP Engineering | Hard — Skeptical, data-driven |
| Marcus Williams | Sales Director | Medium — Experienced, fair |
| Jennifer Rodriguez | CFO | Hard — ROI-obsessed, time-constrained |
| David Park | Product Manager | Easy — Curious, needs internal buy-in |

**20+ scenarios:** Cold calls → Discovery → Demo → Objection → Negotiation → Closing

**Before vs After:**

| Metric | Before QuotaHit | With QuotaHit |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Practice sessions/week | 1-2 (with manager) | 10-20 (with AI) |
| Manager time spent | 3 hrs/week | 0 hrs/week |
| Rep confidence (Day 30) | Low | High |
| Time to first deal | 4-6 months | 6-8 weeks |

[Visual: Show a phone/microphone icon with waveform visualization. Table showing before/after metrics with green arrows on the "After" column. Persona cards with avatars and difficulty badges]

*Speaker Note: "This is our secret weapon. Your reps can practice a CFO negotiation 20 times before the real call. The AI pushes back, raises objections, and tests their skills — 24/7, no scheduling needed."*

---

## SLIDE 8 — Module 3: Call Analyzer

### From Guessing to Knowing

**What it does:** Upload any sales call recording → Get an AI performance report in 60 seconds

**Scoring dimensions:**

[Visual: Circular/radial chart showing 4 dimensions with scores]

| Dimension | What It Measures | Example Score |
|-----------|-----------------|:---:|
| Discovery | Quality of questions, needs uncovered | 78/100 |
| Rapport | Connection, empathy, active listening | 85/100 |
| Objection Handling | Response quality, frameworks used | 62/100 |
| Next Steps | Clear actions, commitment obtained | 71/100 |

**What the AI report includes:**
- Overall score with color coding (Green 85+, Amber 70-84, Red <70)
- Talk ratio (rep vs prospect speaking %)
- Key positive moments highlighted
- Specific areas for improvement
- Save analysis directly to CRM contact record

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours per call review → 60 seconds

[Visual: Mock call analysis report UI showing radar chart with 4 scores, talk ratio bar (40/60 split), and key moments list. Clean, data-rich design]

*Speaker Note: "Your managers currently spend hours reviewing calls. With QuotaHit, any call gets analyzed in 60 seconds with objective scoring. No bias, no inconsistency. And the rep gets actionable feedback, not vague opinions."*

---

## SLIDE 9 — Module 4: Smart CRM

### CRM That Actually Helps You Sell

**What it does:** Purpose-built sales CRM with AI enrichment and pipeline management

**Key capabilities:**

- **Contact Management** — Full records with search, filter, tags, notes
- **Deal Pipeline** — 7-stage kanban: New → Contacted → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Won/Lost
- **AI Enrichment** — Click "Enrich" → AI fills company data, industry, buying signals
- **Lead Scoring** — AI-powered 0-100 scores based on engagement signals
- **Activity Tracking** — Log calls, emails, meetings against contacts
- **CSV Import** — Bulk import with deduplication + auto lead scoring
- **Follow-Up Alerts** — Never miss a follow-up again

**Why not just use Salesforce?**

| Feature | Salesforce | QuotaHit CRM |
|---------|:---:|:---:|
| Price/user/mo | $75-300 | Included |
| AI coaching integration | No | Built-in |
| Call analysis linked | No (needs Gong) | Built-in |
| Setup time | Weeks | Minutes |
| AI enrichment | Add-on ($$$) | Included |

[Visual: Pipeline kanban board screenshot with deals in different stages. Comparison table with green checkmarks for QuotaHit vs red X's for missing Salesforce features]

*Speaker Note: "We're not trying to replace Salesforce for enterprise companies with 1,000 reps. But for teams of 5-50? QuotaHit's CRM does everything they need — and it's connected to the coaching and calling engine. No integration headaches."*

---

## SLIDE 10 — Module 5: AI Calling Engine

### AI That Makes Calls For You

**What it does:** Create AI-powered outbound campaigns that make real phone calls, qualify leads, and book meetings — automatically.

**How it works:**
```
1. Create Campaign → Set objective, select AI voice, upload script
2. Add Contacts → Import from CRM or CSV
3. Launch → AI calls each contact
4. AI Qualifies → Asks qualification questions
5. Books Meeting → Interested? Calendar invite sent
6. Reports → See outcomes, listen to recordings, read transcripts
```

**Campaign Dashboard shows:**
- Total Calls | Connected Calls | Meetings Booked
- Average Duration | Connect Rate | Meeting Rate
- Call-by-call outcomes with AI scoring and sentiment

**Use case: Webinar follow-up**
> 150 webinar attendees → AI calls all within 24 hours → 23 meetings booked → 0 rep time spent

[Visual: Campaign dashboard mockup showing 6 stat cards with real numbers. Below: timeline showing webinar → AI calls → meetings booked]

*Speaker Note: "Imagine this: your team runs a webinar with 150 attendees. Instead of your SDRs manually calling each one over the next week, QuotaHit's AI calls ALL of them within 24 hours. By Monday morning, your AEs have 23 meetings on their calendar."*

---

## SLIDE 11 — Module 6: Performance Analytics

### Data-Driven Coaching

**What it does:** Tracks every practice session, coaching query, and call analysis — showing trends, skill gaps, and improvement over time.

**Dashboard includes:**

[Visual: Analytics dashboard with 4 quadrants]

| Quadrant | Visual | What It Shows |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Top Left | Line chart (30 days) | Score trend over time |
| Top Right | Radar chart (6 axes) | Skills: Discovery, Objections, Closing, Rapport, Value Prop, Listening |
| Bottom Left | Heatmap (4 weeks) | Daily activity intensity |
| Bottom Right | Table | Session history: Date, Type, Score, Duration |

**Manager view:**
- Compare reps side-by-side
- Identify who needs coaching on what
- Track improvement after training initiatives

**ROI proof for leadership:**
> "Average team score improved from 62 → 79 after 3 months. Win rate increased 23%."

[Visual: Mock radar chart showing a rep's skills — strong in Rapport (85), weak in Closing (55). Line chart showing upward trend from 62 to 79 over 12 weeks]

*Speaker Note: "This is what makes QuotaHit a management tool, not just a rep tool. You can see exactly which skills each rep needs to develop, assign targeted practice, and prove ROI to your VP of Sales with real data."*

---

## SLIDE 12 — The ROI Slide (Critical)

### QuotaHit Pays for Itself in 30 Days

**Cost comparison for a 10-person sales team:**

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------|:---:|:---:|
| Gong (Call Analytics) | $1,500-2,500 | $18,000-30,000 |
| Salesforce (CRM) | $750-3,000 | $9,000-36,000 |
| Orum (AI Dialer) | $2,500 | $30,000 |
| Second Nature (Training) | $1,000+ | $12,000+ |
| Outreach (Engagement) | $1,400-2,200 | $16,800-26,400 |
| **Total** | **$7,150-11,200** | **$85,800-134,400** |

**vs.**

| QuotaHit Professional | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------------------|:---:|:---:|
| 10 users × $149/mo | $1,490 | $14,304 (20% annual discount) |

### You save: $71,496 - $120,096 per year

[Visual: HUGE bar chart — tall red bar ($85K-134K) labeled "Current Stack" next to short green bar ($14K) labeled "QuotaHit". The difference highlighted with a savings callout "$71K-120K SAVED"]

**Plus the revenue impact:**
- 23% higher win rate (from better coaching)
- 40% faster rep ramp (from AI practice)
- 10x more outbound calls (from AI calling)
- 2-3 hrs/week saved per manager (from auto call review)

**Conservative estimate:** $200K+ additional revenue per year from improved rep performance

[Visual: Small bar chart showing revenue lift: current revenue bar vs. revenue with QuotaHit (+23% highlighted)]

*Speaker Note: "Let me put this plainly. You're currently spending $85K-134K per year on 5-7 separate tools. QuotaHit replaces ALL of them for $14K per year. That's an 80-90% cost reduction. And the performance improvement alone — 23% higher win rate — could mean $200K+ in additional revenue."*

## SLIDE 13 — Competitive Landscape

### How QuotaHit Compares

[Visual: Comparison matrix with green/red/amber cells]

| Capability | QuotaHit | Gong | Salesloft | Orum | Second Nature |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AI Coaching | **Yes** | No | No | No | Limited |
| Voice Practice | **Yes** | No | No | No | Yes |
| Call Analysis | **Yes** | Yes | Limited | No | No |
| CRM | **Yes** | No | No | No | No |
| AI Outbound Calling | **Yes** | No | No | Yes | No |
| Pipeline Management | **Yes** | No | Limited | No | No |
| Performance Analytics | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Limited | Limited |
| AI Models (count) | **25+** | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| **Price/user/mo** | **$79-249** | $108-250 | $140-220 | $250 | $100+ |

**QuotaHit is the ONLY platform that does ALL of this.**

[Visual: Radar/spider chart overlay — QuotaHit polygon covers all 7 capabilities (large), competitors cover 1-3 each (small). Makes it visually obvious QuotaHit is comprehensive]

*Speaker Note: "Look at this matrix. Gong does call analytics. Orum does outbound dialing. Second Nature does role-play. But NONE of them do everything. QuotaHit is the only platform that covers the entire sales workflow — coaching, practice, calling, CRM, and analytics — in one tool."*

---

## SLIDE 14 — Market Positioning

### Positioned for the $30B Sales Tech Market

[Visual: 2x2 matrix/quadrant chart]

**X-axis:** Narrow (single feature) → Comprehensive (full platform)
**Y-axis:** Low AI ($) → Advanced AI ($$$)

| Quadrant | Companies |
|----------|-----------|
| Low AI + Narrow | Basic CRMs, manual dialers |
| Low AI + Comprehensive | Salesforce, HubSpot |
| High AI + Narrow | Gong (analytics only), Orum (dialing only) |
| **High AI + Comprehensive** | **QuotaHit (alone in this quadrant)** |

**Market size:**
- Sales enablement: $3.4B (growing 15% YoY)
- Conversation intelligence: $1.8B (growing 22% YoY)
- Sales engagement: $5.6B (growing 12% YoY)
- AI in sales (total): $30B+ by 2028

**QuotaHit sits at the intersection of ALL three categories.**

[Visual: 2x2 quadrant with company logos placed in each quadrant. QuotaHit logo large in top-right "High AI + Comprehensive" quadrant with a star/glow effect]

*Speaker Note: "The sales tech market is $30 billion and growing fast. But every player is siloed — Gong does analytics, Orum does dialing, Salesforce does CRM. QuotaHit is the first platform to combine ALL of these with advanced AI. We're creating a new category."*

---

## SLIDE 15 — AI Models Advantage

### 25+ AI Models. You Choose.

**Why it matters:** Different AI models excel at different tasks. QuotaHit lets you pick the best model for each situation.

| Model | Provider | Best For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| GPT-5.2 | OpenAI | Complex reasoning, detailed analysis |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Anthropic | Nuanced coaching, long conversations |
| GPT-4.1 | OpenAI | Fast, reliable responses |
| Kimi K2.5 | Moonshot | Cost-efficient, high quality |
| Gemini 3 Flash | Google | Ultra-fast, real-time use |
| Grok 4 Fast | xAI | Multi-modal, large context |
| Llama 4 Maverick | Meta | Open source, privacy-focused |
| + 18 more | Various | Specialized tasks |

**Competitors lock you into ONE model.**
QuotaHit gives you 25+ to choose from — always using the latest and best.

[Visual: Grid of AI provider logos (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, Moonshot) with model names listed under each. QuotaHit logo in center connecting to all of them]

*Speaker Note: "Every competitor locks you into a single AI model. What happens when a better model comes out? You're stuck. With QuotaHit, we support 25+ models from every major provider. Your team always has access to the latest AI, automatically."*

---

## SLIDE 16 — Security & Enterprise Readiness

### Enterprise-Grade Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth (Magic link + OAuth) |
| Data Isolation | Row-Level Security — users can ONLY see their own data |
| Encryption | TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest |
| API Security | Bearer token auth on all endpoints |
| Compliance | DNC flags, do-not-email per contact |
| Infrastructure | Vercel (auto-scaling, global CDN) + Supabase (managed PostgreSQL) |

**Scalability:**
- Vercel: Auto-scales to millions of requests
- Supabase: Enterprise PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- Stripe: PCI-compliant payment processing
- 99.9% uptime SLA

[Visual: Shield icon in center with security layers radiating outward. Clean, professional design with lock icons and checkmarks]

*Speaker Note: "Security is not an afterthought. Every table has Row-Level Security — meaning a rep in Company A physically cannot access Company B's data. It's enforced at the database level, not just the application level."*

---

## SLIDE 17 — How It Works (Implementation)

### Live in 15 Minutes

| Step | Time | What Happens |
|------|:---:|------|
| 1. Sign Up | 2 min | Create account, verify email |
| 2. Import Contacts | 5 min | CSV upload or manual entry |
| 3. Configure AI Model | 1 min | Select preferred model in Settings |
| 4. Start Practicing | 2 min | Pick a persona, start a voice session |
| 5. Upload First Call | 3 min | Get instant AI analysis |
| 6. Invite Team | 2 min | Share invite link |

**No implementation project. No consultants. No 6-month rollout.**

Compare to Salesforce: 3-6 months implementation, $50K+ setup costs

[Visual: Horizontal timeline with 6 steps, each with an icon and time. Total time "15 minutes" highlighted. Below: contrast with Salesforce "6 months, $50K+" crossed out in red]

*Speaker Note: "One of the biggest advantages: there is no implementation project. Your team can be up and running in 15 minutes. Compare that to Salesforce, which takes 3-6 months and costs $50K+ in implementation fees."*

---

## SLIDE 18 — Pricing

### Simple, Transparent Pricing

[Visual: 4 pricing cards side by side, Professional highlighted/elevated as "Most Popular"]

| | Starter | Professional | Business | Enterprise |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Price** | $79/user/mo | **$149/user/mo** | $249/user/mo | Custom |
| AI Coaching | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Voice Practice | Limited | **Unlimited** | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Call Analysis | 10/mo | **Unlimited** | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| CRM Contacts | 500 | **5,000** | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| AI Calling | — | **500 min/mo** | 2,000 min/mo | Custom |
| AI Agents | — | **3** | 10 | Unlimited |
| AI Models | 10 | **25+** | 25+ | 25+ + Custom |
| Team Size | 1 | **Up to 10** | Up to 50 | Unlimited |
| Support | Email | **Priority** | Dedicated CSM | White-glove |

**20% discount on annual plans**

**Professional plan = $149/user/mo**
**→ Less than what you pay for Gong ALONE ($250/user/mo)**

[Visual: Pricing cards with Professional card slightly larger/elevated with "Most Popular" badge. Green highlight on the price comparison at bottom]

*Speaker Note: "Our Professional plan at $149 per user per month gives you everything — unlimited coaching, practice, call analysis, CRM, and 500 minutes of AI calling. That's less than what you'd pay for Gong alone. And Gong only does call recording."*

## SLIDE 19 — ROI Calculator (Interactive Slide)

### Calculate Your ROI

**Input your numbers:**

| Input | Your Value | Example |
|-------|:---:|:---:|
| Number of reps | ___ | 10 |
| Average deal size | $___ | $25,000 |
| Current win rate | ___% | 22% |
| Deals per rep per quarter | ___ | 8 |
| Current tool spend/rep/mo | $___ | $400 |

**Output (with QuotaHit):**

| Metric | Current | With QuotaHit | Change |
|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Win rate | 22% | 27% (+23%) | +$450K/yr revenue |
| Rep ramp time | 9 months | 5 months | -$115K in wasted salary |
| Tool cost (annual) | $48,000 | $17,880 | -$30,120 saved |
| Manager hours saved | 0 | 520 hrs/yr | 13 weeks of selling time back |
| **Total annual impact** | | | **+$595K** |

**Payback period: < 30 days**

[Visual: Calculator-style layout. Left side: input fields. Right side: output with big green numbers. Bottom: "Payback: <30 days" in a highlighted box]

*Speaker Note: "Let's run the numbers with your team. If you have 10 reps doing $25K average deals... even a 5-point win rate improvement — which our data shows is conservative — means $450K in additional revenue. Add the $30K in tool savings, and you're looking at nearly $600K in annual impact. QuotaHit pays for itself in less than 30 days."*

## SLIDE 20 — Customer Success Scenarios

### What Success Looks Like

**Scenario 1: Mid-Market SaaS (15 reps)**
- Before: Reps trained 2x/year in workshops. $45K spent on Gong + Salesforce + training
- After: Daily AI practice, instant call reviews, unified CRM
- Result: Win rate up 19%, ramp time down 40%, tool spend cut 70%

**Scenario 2: Insurance Sales Team (8 reps)**

- After: AI calling 200+ contacts/day, real-time coaching, digital pipeline
- Result: 3x more conversations, 2x more appointments, full pipeline visibility

**Scenario 3: Enterprise Sales (25 reps, 5 managers)**
- Before: Gong + Salesforce + Outreach + coaching vendor = $250K/year
- After: QuotaHit Business plan = $75K/year
- Result: Same capabilities, $175K saved, single platform, faster adoption

[Visual: 3 horizontal cards, each with company type icon, before/after metrics, and result callout. Use green arrow indicators for improvements]

*Speaker Note: "Whether you're a 8-person insurance team or a 25-person enterprise sales org, the math works. Let me show you the scenario that's closest to your situation..."*
